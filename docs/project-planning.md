- Write a Definition Statement
  - I want to build an application that is a property management tool. This application will be designed to work on desktop and mobile phone displays.
- Define your Audience
  - Who is using my application
        Anyone that wants to keep track of resources at their home would use this application.
- Outline the content of the application
  - What do I want on each page?  (text / pics / images / navigation)
        The home page will have choices to add, update, delete, or query an item. Each additional page will expand on those navigation items with a form to add, update/delete, or query for a particular item based on the selection from the main page. The pages will be geared more to data and less images/pictures. I would like to include a weather API that gives the current weather conditions to show the user if it's a good day to use the items in the database, even if they might only be repairing/maintaining one. It will also include an About Me and Contact Us page.
  - What do I want the functionality of each page to be?
      -The Home page will have the weather API at the top. Under that it will show buttons so the user can select what function they would like to do, like add, update/delete, query and report on equipment.
      -Page 2 will be a form to allow the user to enter in all of the information for a piece of equipment.
      -Page 3 will have a search box for the user to enter the equipment that they would like to update or delete. After the equipment has been located in the database, it will display in an editable form to allow the user to update/delete information or the item.
      -Page 4 will have  search box so the user can query the database and run a report on the item. It will pull up the item information in a non-editable form for the user to view.
      -Page 5 will show the About Us and Contact Us information.
  - What is the purpose of my application?
        It keeps track of any equipment that runs on gas, battery, or electric and lives in the shed or is used in the garden or for the lawn. It will be categorized as lawn and garden to allow for future expansion to cover items in the house and garage. It will contain all item information like purchase date, model, make, serial number, model number, maintenance frequency, last time maintenance was performed, what type of parts were replaced, when and from where the parts were acquired, etc.
  - What business problem or real world problem am I going to be solving?
        This will hook up to a database and allow a user to add, update, delete, or query an item and show a report. This type of application can be repurposed to most anything that requires a database to store, parse, add, and delete data.
  - Define the attributes of your website
    - Color Palette - #0D0A0B #F3EFF5 #72B01D #507C13 #456911
    - Images - Images will include icons that show the user what page they're on as far as adding, updating, deleting, or searching for an item.
    - Fonts - Roboto - Clean and simple

    - Navigation - The top nav bar for all pages will include links to add, update, delete, search for an item, and contact and about us page.
