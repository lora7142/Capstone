      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I like a challenge and thrive when there’s a problem to solve. Learning new skills and software is no sweat! I once learned to use two different 3D modeling programs within two months. Phew! During the pandemic I took up leather craft to challenge myself. I have created some cool pieces and am still learning something new every day.</p>
      <p>I’ve lived in St. Louis all my life. I even stayed local for university. Go LU Lions! When the weather is nice, you can catch me walking around the park, biking, playing pickleball, tennis or volleyball. I look forward to the summer when bands come to town and I can catch a live show. I also enjoy gardening and experimenting with different plants every year.</p>
      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>I like to bike, play tennis, play pickle ball, play volleyball, workout, garden, leather craft, and music.</p>
